* code to update the number of drones in the game asynchonously. 
* Update: 5/12/2016, Reved to verion 1.1.31, Combined the GameController and screen text scripts and objects. Preformed a refactor of the
* game controller and FirstPersonController. Increased the firepower of the machine gun, so it is not so useless. Modified game to dynamically

* Update: 5/25/2016, Reved to version 1.1.41 (Alpha 11) Fixed a minor issue where the raycast from the 
* turret script and drone script was not taking into account the range of the ammo. Fixed an issue where the
* battlecruisers destruction was causing all the drones to self destruct. Fixed an issue wher allied portals 
* are destroyable in survival mode. Removed colliders from weapons as these were interfering with the
* drone targeting. Adjusted the player controller object so all child objects are centered (as this was
* also interfering with the drone targeting.) Modified the GameController to not launch a tactical drone

5/28/2016, Reved to version 1.1.44 (Alpha 12), Improved the guided rocket
* now the rocket sends a raycast to find any target directly in front of it before
* attempting to aquire another target. Rocket turn radius has been decreased for better
* accuracy. Modified the rocket trails to look better when the rockets turn and curve.
* Update: 5/30/2016, Reved to version 1.1.45 (Alpha 12), Replaced the health text with a

* destroyed. Fixed another issue where tactical drones were not being counted as destroyed. Decreased
* the crate drop rate of the battle cruiser. Fixed some issues with how and when battle cruisers are launched
* and how the counts are handled for Survival Mode. Cruiser speed decreases as more cruisers are launched. This makes the game
* more difficult as it becomes more difficult to fight off the drones they produce. No longer updating the screen text
* when points are scored (as the tick timer updates this for us). Added code to launch cruisers in waves after
* a certain number of them have passed by. Only incrementing the score if the objects health is at 0; this fixes
* an issue where the player score increments when a battlecruiser passes the screen. Added the game over screen overlay
* this will now display "Game Over" when the player is defeated. Fixed an issue in the projectile script where projectiles
* were Instantiating explosions when destroyed at the end of the game. Optimized this script so objects that detonate
* only make an explosion when they call their detonate function. Modified the menu script to enable or disable the

* the fps controller settings when the victory is achieved. Save point now increases player health. Increased the width and boldness
* of temporary text. Adjusted the masses of each bullet to make it more realistic. Removed code that saves game objects in the load
* game object function. Game Objects can only be saved when a save point is passed. (this may be why game objects were doubled). Reduced
* the number of crates that get re-spawned when a crate is destroyed. Added the new fall again script. This is to handle objects that get
* stuck in the air. Fixed an issue where grenades were not exploding. 
Update: 6/6/2016, Reved to version 1.1.50 (Alpha 13), Fixed an issue 
* where the scoring was no longer functional. Added ammo and health to the
* top platform, also increased the collider width of some of the narrow
* platforms, to make the game a bit more forgiving. Decreased the drone rate of the battlecruiser
* in non-survival modes. Fixed an issue where the weapon ammo was not being reset
* on victory or defeat. Fixed the issue where turrets were being saved double
* in mini game. Fixed an issue where the wrong weapon text was being displayed on startup.
* Update: 6/7/2016, Reved to version 1.1.51 (Alpha 13), Fixed an issue where
* ammo pickup sounds were not playing. Fixed an issue where sounds were not plaing in survival mode
* Fixed an issue where it was possible to destroy portholes in survival mode. Decreased
* starting cruiser launch time in the game controller. Fixed an issue where 3 cruisers were appearing
* on the intense wave when it should have only been 2. Also added a third wave of 6 cruisers.
* Update: 6/8/2016, Reved to version 1.1.52 (Alpha 13), Added special thanks notes to the 
* about dialog text. Moved the weapon text up. Modified the code for survival mode to give the player
* a longer rest after fighting two battle cruisers. Also fixed an issue where two more battle cruisers
* would come after the first two.
